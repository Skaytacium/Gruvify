# Gruvify
## Gruvbox spotify theme

### What?

A [spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) theme customized to the [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox) palette.  
Uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) compiled down to normal CSS.

### Why?

Eyesore.

### And?

Has a polycolor branch, which has colors but I don't think I'll be maintaining that.
