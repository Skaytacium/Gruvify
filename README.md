# Gruvify
## Gruvbox spotify theme

### What?

A [spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) theme customized to the [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox) palette.
Uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) compiled down to normal CSS.

### Why?

Eyesore.

### Installation?

Do the following in the spicetify `Themes` folder (you need `npm`):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Skaytacium/Gruvify
cd Gruvify
npm i -g sass
sass user.sass user.css
```
Change the theme to `Gruvify`
```sh
spicetify config current_theme Gruvify
spicetify apply
```

### And?

~~Supports spicetify's [bookmark extension](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/extensions/#bookmark).~~ It still does, but, on older versions (check the tricolor branch).

The `main` branch is based on the current Spotify CSS map, the `tricolor` branch is based on the older one, it supports vim keys and bookmarks theming as well (since those extensions aren't available for the newer versions, I can't theme them).
