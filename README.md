# Gruvify
## Gruvbox spotify theme

### What?

A [spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) theme customized to the [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox) palette.
Uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) compiled down to normal CSS.

### Why?

Eyesore.

### And?

~~Supports spicetify's [bookmark extension](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/extensions/#bookmark).~~ It still does, but, on older versions (check the tricolor branch).

#### Versioning info

The `main` branch is based on the current Spotify CSS map, the `tricolor` branch is based on the older one, it supports vim keys and bookmarks theming as well (since those extensions aren't available for the newer versions, I can't theme them).
